# RouteMaker Instructions

## Welcome to RouteMaker!
Did you ever want to make plans for a trip but
didn't know where to start?
For instance, if you wanted to travel to New York, 
where should you go? When should you go?

Even if you knew where to go, in what order should you arrange
those to minimize your cost and time?

## RouteMaker to the rescue.

The following is a short instruction that will help you make full
use of RouteMaker's functionalities.

### We will provide instructions on how to:
##### 1. Create a new trip #####
##### 2. Edit an existing trip #####
##### 3. View past trips #####

## 1. Creating a New Trip
1.1 Open the menu on the top lefthand corner.
1.2 Click "Create Trip"
1.3 Follow the steps that we guide you through.
Note: Unless you run through the entire process, we will not save
the trip you were editing to your account. If you want to come back
to the app and edit the trip later, you need to at least "finalize"
a rough draft of your trip plan.

## 2. Editing an Existing Trip
2.1 Open the menu on the top lefthand corner.
2.2 Click "Current Trips"
2.3 Click on the trip you want to keep editing.
2.4 You will be directed to the schedule page--you can add/delete 
sites as many times as you want! But beware, once you are in this 
mode, we will not show you an optimized route--we just do that for
you in the beginning. Believe us, it's for your benefit! 

## 3. Viewing Past Trips
3.1 Open the menu on the top lefthand corner.
3.2 Click "Past Trips"
3.3 Click on the past trip you want to view.
